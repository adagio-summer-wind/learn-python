# 1、数据类型特征
* dynamically typed language
* strongly typed language
* explicit type casting

1、dynamically
========
>Python is a dynamically and strongly typed language.Dynamic typing means that only runtime objects (values) have a type,<br> 
>but not the variables that store them. You are able   to store several values of different types in a single variable
>during your code execution and no errors will occur.  

>The following code is totally valid:
  ```python
  v = 10  # variable v stores an integer value

  v = 'hello'  # v now stores a string
  ```
2、strongly typed
==========
>Strong typing means that implicit type conversions don't happen. For example, even though "125" consists only of digits<br>
>it's a string. To use it in arithmetic operations you need to change its type to an integer or another numerical type. 
>If Python had a weak type system, such value could be interpreted as an integer to successfully perform the operation. 
>Such behavior, when one of the operands is implicitly converted to the type of another operand, is called type coercion. 
>there is no type of coercion in Python

3、explicit type casting
======
>The process of converting a value to another type is also called type casting. Though implicit type casting isn't allowed
> in Python you will often find yourself in need to define an explicit type conversion within your code. This happens a 
> lot when you work with the user's input.
